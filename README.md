### 🙋🏻‍♂️ About me

The name is **Kevin**. I'm a Frontend Developer from France 🥖  
I breathe life into **creative** and **functional** web interfaces with a sharp focus on **accessible user experiences**. I like the idea of making the web an inclusive place for everyone, one line of code at a time.

I work with _Laravel_, _Vue.js_, _Tailwind CSS_, _Alpine.js_, and more. I'm also interested about DevOps stuff, 3D rendering and more recently AI and LLMs.  

When I'm not programming, I'm likely to be found in a bar with some friends, a good beer or/and a Gin and Tonic.  
I also have a soft spot for music. Although I might not be the next David Gilmour, I take pleasure in tinkering with a guitar, a Mac, a MIDI Controller, trying to transform the melodies in my head into my own unique tunes.

Regardless of what I'm doing, I'm always chasing creativity, authenticity, and a sense of connection.

> Here's to a world where code, drinks, music, cats and good company intersect! 😌
